        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I was born in a log cabin, with a weak fire by my mother... no wait that's someone else.</p>
        <p>Yo my name is Cory and this is my story... actually sorry I took that from That's So RavenÂ®</p>
        <p>I'm a coder from New York who is also a musician. I enjoy playing trombone, producing, and making original software to better the people. Catch me outside, how about that?</p>
